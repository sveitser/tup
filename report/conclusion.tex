\section{Conclusion}
We have set out with the goal of creating a model to determine the interests of twitter users based on their tweets. Due to twitter specific properties and for reasons of scalability we require an online learning algorithm. Based on magnificent work by Blei, Hoffman and others in the field of topic modelling we were able to create two similar models that solved the task at hand reasonably well.

Finally we note that this was arguably too challenging a project to complete in one semester without much prior knowledge about the topic. As a result there is lot left to be done. Ideally we would use a hierarchical Dirichlet Process such that the model can discover the number of topics and create new ones once when necessary.
