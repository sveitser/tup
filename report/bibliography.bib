@article{Geman84,
    abstract = {{We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, non-linear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low-energy states ('annealing'), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel 'relaxation' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.}},

    abstract = {{Gradient adaptation is a useful technique for adjusting a set of parameters to minimize a cost function. While often easy to implement, the convergence speed of gradient adaptation can be slow when the slope of the cost function varies widely for small changes in the parameters. In this paper, we outline an alternative technique, termed natural gradient adaptation, that overcomes the poor convergence properties of gradient adaptation in many cases. The natural gradient is based on differential geometry and employs knowledge of the Riemannian structure of the parameter space to adjust the gradient search direction. Unlike Newton's method, natural gradient adaptation does not assume a locally-quadratic cost function. Moreover, for maximum likelihood estimation tasks, natural gradient adaptation is asymptotically Fisher-efficient. A simple example illustrates the desirable properties of natural gradient adaptation}},
